# Yoko Li - Executive Briefing

## Background

[Yoko Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yokoli/) is a Partner at [Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)](https://a16z.com/) on the [AI & Infrastructure team](https://a16z.com/infra/). She brings deep technical credibility as a former product leader and engineer who still actively codes.

**Career Highlights:**
- **[HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)**: Led product for [Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform), the infrastructure-as-code platform that became the standard for DevOps
- **Transposit**: Founding Engineer/PM at this workflow automation startup
- **[AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/)**: Software engineer at the APM company that sold to Cisco for $3.7B
- **Education**: [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) (Engineering)

**What Makes Her Unique:**
She maintains active open source projects including [AI-town](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town) (a virtual town where AI characters live and socialize) and [AI-tamago](https://github.com/ykhli/AI-tamago) (an LLM-driven virtual pet). She's also known as a [technical cartoonist](https://x.com/stuffyokodraws). This combination of hands-on technical work and creative expression means she values founders who can both build and communicate.

## Investment Thesis & Key Ideas

### Core Philosophy
*"AI agents as the next computing platform"* - Not AI as tooling, but AI as the foundation for how software gets built.

Source: [Nine Emerging Developer Patterns for the AI Era](https://a16z.com/nine-emerging-developer-patterns-for-the-ai-era/) (May 2025)

### Key Concepts She's Coined/Championed

#### 1. "Agent Experience (AX)" not just "Developer Experience (DX)"
- Products should be designed for AI agents to use, not just humans
- APIs should be "agent-friendly" from day one

Discussed in: [Automating Developer Email with MCP and AI Agents](https://a16z.com/podcast/automating-developer-email-with-mcp-and-al-agents/) podcast with [Resend](https://resend.com/) CEO Zeno Rocha

#### 2. "Composable Service Primitives"

> *"Just like human developers lean on Stripe for payments, Clerk for auth, or Supabase for database capabilities, agents need similarly clean and composable service primitives to scaffold reliable applications."*
>
> — [Nine Emerging Developer Patterns for the AI Era](https://a16z.com/nine-emerging-developer-patterns-for-the-ai-era/)

Each company provides a discrete building block (auth, email, docs, workflows) that agents can reliably integrate.

#### 3. Vertical Integration as Moat
- As LLMs commoditize, owning the full stack creates defensibility
- Don't build middleware - own the complete experience

#### 4. AI-Native Architecture (Not Bolt-On)
- Recent focus on [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://a16z.com/a-deep-dive-into-mcp-and-the-future-of-ai-tooling/) for connecting LLMs to tools
- Looking for companies rebuilt from ground up for AI, not legacy systems with AI added

Deep dive: [MCP Co-Creator on the Next Wave of LLM Innovation](https://a16z.com/podcast/mcp-co-creator-on-the-next-wave-of-llm-innovation/) podcast with Anthropic's David Soria Parra

#### 5. Infrastructure Over Applications
- Developer tools that solve hard technical problems
- Depth > breadth; primitives > features

## How to Position for This Investor

### The Framework
Position as **infrastructure/primitive**, not consumer app. Use her language:
- "Primitive" or "infrastructure" not "app"
- "Agent-native" not "AI-powered"
- Reference composability with her other portfolio companies

### One-Liner Template
*"We're building the [domain] primitive for AI agents - just as [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is the auth primitive and [Resend](https://resend.com/) is the email primitive, [Company] is the [domain] primitive."*

### Why This Framework Works
1. **Primitive Framework** - Speaks her language (see [her article](https://a16z.com/nine-emerging-developer-patterns-for-the-ai-era/))
2. **Vertical Integration** - Own full stack like all her investments
3. **AI-Native** - Built from ground up as agent-operated system
4. **Developer DNA** - Technical founders with domain expertise
5. **Replaces Fragmented Systems** - Legacy tools → one unified platform

## Key Portfolio Analogies to Use in Conversation

**When discussing vertical integration:**
> "It's like how [Resend](https://resend.com/) doesn't just wrap SendGrid - they own the entire email sending experience end-to-end. We own the entire [domain] experience end-to-end."

**When discussing developer experience:**
> "You led product at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) - you know [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) succeeded because it abstracted away infrastructure complexity. We're doing the same for [domain]."

**When discussing AI-native design:**
> "[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) doesn't just add AI chat to docs - they designed docs from the ground up to be [agent-readable](https://mintlify.com/ai-native-documentation-tool). We designed [domain] from the ground up to be agent-operated."

**When discussing production reliability:**
> "We've thought a lot about what [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) solves - [running AI workflows reliably in production](https://www.inngest.com/ai). That's critical for us because [specific reason]. Here's our approach..."

## Anticipated Questions & Counters

### Q1: "Why not sell to enterprises instead of B2C?"
**Counter:** "We need real end-user behavioral data to train our AI. Enterprise deals would take 24 months and we'd be integrating with their legacy systems - that defeats the purpose of being AI-native. B2C gives us the fastest learning loop and proves unit economics. Same playbook as [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) going from indie devs to enterprise."

### Q2: "What's defensible? Can't [Big Tech + Incumbent] do this?"
**Counter:** "Three moats: (1) Domain-specific data we're collecting 24/7 - no one else has this context, (2) Regulatory/technical barriers that take 12-18 months, (3) Incumbents can't reorganize around AI - classic innovator's dilemma. This is infrastructure that needs to be built from scratch."

### Q3: "How do you handle LLM non-determinism in production?"
**Counter:** "Great question - we run agents in a constrained environment with guardrails: circuit breakers, fallback logic, test suites. Similar to how [Inngest handles workflow reliability](https://www.inngest.com/blog/principles-of-production-ai), we've built observability and rollback into every agent action."

### Q4: "Walk me through cohort retention economics"
**Counter:** [Have detailed cohort data ready - month 1-12+ retention curves, ARPU trends, LTV calculation methodology]
